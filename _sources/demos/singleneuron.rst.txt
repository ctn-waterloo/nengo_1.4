A single neuron
===============

**Purpose**:
This demo shows how to construct and manipulate a single neuron.

**Comments**:
This leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron
is a simple, standard model of a spiking single neuron.
It resides inside a neural "population",
even though there is only one neuron.

**Usage**:
Grab the slider control and move it up and down
to see the effects of increasing or decreasing input.
This neuron will fire faster with more input (an "on" neuron).

      This is a single neuron simulation in Nengo.
      Here we have the input to the neuron.
      That input is driving the subthreshold voltage of the cell
      which is plotted here in blue.
      This plot is quite noisy because the simulation itself
      includes some Gaussian noise.
      Each time this subthreshold voltage
      crosses the threshold at the top of the graph
      the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron
      that we are simulating generates a spike.
      Those spikes are shown up here.
      These are action potentials generated by the cell.
      This is another view of those action potentials as well.
      Each time an action potential is generated
      a yellow square appears,
      otherwise the subthreshold voltage is shown as grayscale.
      The final graph we have is the postsynaptic potential
      that would be induced in a cell
      that was receiving the spike train from this cell.
      We can control this simulation
      by grabbing the input and increasing it.
      As we increase it, this particular neuron
      will become more active with an increase in the input.
      You see that the spike raster
      has more spikes and the subthreshold voltage graph
      is crossing that threshold more often.
      And as we decrease the input
      we can see that the neuron's activity slows
      and eventually turns off completely.
