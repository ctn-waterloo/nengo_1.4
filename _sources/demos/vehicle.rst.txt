Simple vehicle
==============

**Purpose**:
This demo shows an example of integrating Nengo
with a physics engine renderer.

**Comments**:
The demo shows a simple
`Braitenberg vehicle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle>`_
controller attached to a simulated robot (a Dalek from Dr. Who),
that drives in a physical simulation.

Most of the code is demonstrating
how to construct a simple robot
and a simple room in the physical simulator.
Only the last few lines are used to construct the neural controller.

**Usage**:
Hit play and the robot will drive around, avoiding the blocks and walls.
The spikes are generated by measurements of distance from obstacles,
and motor commands to the wheels.
